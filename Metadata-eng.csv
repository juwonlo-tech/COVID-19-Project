Title Notes,,,,,,,
1,"Source: Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), COVID-19 epidemiological reports, with contribution from Provincial/Territorial Ministries of Health. For more information about this dataset please see the website: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/13260002.",,,,,,
2,"Given that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving, these data are considered preliminary. The data published by Statistics Canada only account for those where a detailed case report was provided by the provincial or territorial jurisdiction to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). Statistics Canada’s detailed preliminary confirmed cases will not match the total case reporting done at the provincial and territorial levels which are reported daily by each jurisdiction and compiled by the PHAC.  The discrepancy is due to delays associated with the submission of the detailed information, its capture and coding. Hence, Statistics Canada’s file on detailed case reporting is a subset of the total counts reported by the health authorities across Canada.",,,,,,
3,Confirmed cases are laboratory confirmed cases for which a case report form has been received by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) from provincial or territorial partners.,,,,,,
4,"On November 26th 2020, the data table 13-10-0781-01 of detailed confirmed cases from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) was replaced by a direct-download data file available at the website: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/13260003.",,,,,,
5,"Due to changes in COVID-19 testing policies in many jurisdictions, which were in response to a surge in demand for laboratory testing starting in December 2021, cases may be skewed towards populations deemed high priority for laboratory testing, and case counts will underestimate the total burden of COVID-19 in the population. ",,,,,,
6,"Starting on April 6th, 2022, British Columbia began to report all deaths within 30 days of a positive COVID-19 test as a death due to COVID-19 on this data file, regardless of the cause of death. As a result, deaths in British Columbia from April 6th, 2022 to the present are now over-estimated and should not be compared to other regions or to death counts in the British Columbia region prior to this change.",,,,,,
7,"Starting on June 10th, 2022, the death variable will be derived from the ‘coviddeath’ variable (not available on this dataset). The resolved, resolution week and resolution year variables are no longer available.",,,,,,
8,"On September 16th 2022, no updates were made except for the addition of new cases. No new cases were added for the Quebec region",,,,,,
9,"The file may include some cases for which all of the information is missing, either because no information is available for them or because information is under review. These cases have been kept on the file to reflect a more accurate count of total COVID-19 cases in Canada even though there is no information available on those cases at this point.",,,,,,

Column Notes,,Column Concepts,,,Column Variables,,Column Definitions - Detailed
10,,Case Identifier Number,,,COV_ID,,Statistics Canada generated case identifier number.
11,,Region,,,COV_REG,,"Region: 1 = Atlantic (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador), 2 = Quebec, 3 = Ontario and Nunavut, 4 = Prairies (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba) and the Northwest Territories, 5 = British Columbia and Yukon."
12,,Episode week,,,COV_EW,,"The episode week and episode year are derived from the variable earliest date. The earliest date variable is derived based on the earliest of the following dates: symptom onset date, specimen collection date, laboratory testing date, date reported to the province or territory, or date reported to PHAC. When no date is available, this field is considered 'Not stated' and given the value 99. These values are corrected as Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) receives new information."
13,,,,,,,"""0"" represents the first days of the year leading up to, but not including the first Sunday. ""1"" represents the first full week of the year, beginning on the first Sunday, and so on."
14,,Episode week group,,,COV_EWG,,Derived by Statistics Canada from Episode week. Indicates when multiple episode weeks have been grouped together to protect confidentiality.
12,,Episode year,,,COV_EY,,"The episode week and episode year are derived from the variable earliest date. The earliest date variable is derived based on the earliest of the following dates: symptom onset date, specimen collection date, laboratory testing date, date reported to the province or territory, or date reported to PHAC. When no date is available, this field is considered 'Not stated' and given the value 99. These values are corrected as Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) receives new information."
15,,,,,,,"Year of earliest date. 20 = the year 2020, 21 = the year 2021, 22 = the year 2022, 99 = Not stated."
16,,Gender,,,COV_GDR,,"Gender codes: 1 = Male, 2 = Female, 9 = Not stated. These values are corrected as the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) receives new information.

This was updated in February 2021 so that both French and English forms used the term ‘gender’. In the context of this dataset, the term gender is used throughout. The cases that were not reported as either female or male were reclassified as ‘not stated’ gender."
